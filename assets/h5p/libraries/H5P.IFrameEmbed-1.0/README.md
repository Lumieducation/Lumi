h5p-iframe-embed
================
This H5P library makes it possible to embed "static" content displayed in an iFrame. The source may be internal or external:

  * **External:** URI to external page to embed inside iFrame. The URI is editable using the H5P editor.
  * **Internal:** this means at least the html-file is included in the H5P when beeing uploaded. Uploading html files
  or other resources is not supported by the H5P editor yet.

An example is found in the [h5p-iframe-embed-example](http://github.com/h5p/h5p-iframe-embed-example) git repo
